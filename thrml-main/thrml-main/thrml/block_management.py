class BlockSpec:
    """
    This contains the necessary mappings for logging indices of states and node types.

    This helps convert between block states and global states. A block state is a list
    of pytrees, where each pytree leaf has shape[0] = number of nodes in the block.
    The length of the block state is the number of blocks. The global state is a
    flattened version of this. Each pytree type is combined (regardless of which block
    they are in), to make a list of pytrees where each leaf shape[0] is the total
    number of nodes of that pytree shape. As an example, imagine an Ising model,
    every node is the same pytree (just a scalar array), as such the block state is
    a list of arrays where each array is the state of the block and the global state
    would be a length-1 list that contains an array of shape (total_nodes,).

    Why is this global/block representation necessary? The answer is that the global
    representation is preferred for operating over in many JAX cases, but requires
    careful indexing (to know where in this long array each block resides) and thus
    the block representation is more natural/easy to use for many users. Why is the
    global state easier to work with? Well consider sampling, in order to sample a
    block (or even just a node) we need to collect all the states of the neighboring
    nodes. If we only had the block state we would have to loop over the block state
    and collect from each block the neighbors, we would then pass this to the
    sampler. The sampler would then have to know the type of each block (to know
    what to do with the states) then for loop over the blocks in order to collect
    each. This (programmatically) is fine, but results in additional for loops that
    slow down JAX, compared to gathering indexes from a single array.


    **Attributes:**

    - `blocks`: the list of blocks this spec contains
    - `all_block_sds`: a SD is a single `_PyTreeStruct`. Each node/block has only
        one SD associated with it, but each node can have neighbors of many types.
        This is the SD of each block (in the same order as blocks, this internal
        ordering is quite important for bookkeeping). This list is just the list
        of SDs for each block (and thus has length = len(blocks)).
    - `global_sd_order`: the list of SDs, providing a SoT for the global ordering
    - `sd_index_map`: a dictionary mapping the SD to an integer in the
        `global_sd_order`. This is like calling `.index` on it.
    - `node_global_location_map`: a dictionary mapping a given node to a tuple.
        That tuple contains the global index (i.e. which element in the global
        list it is in) and the relative position in that pytree. That is to say,
        you can get the state of the node via
        `map(x[tuple[1]], global_repr[tuple[0]])`
    - `block_to_global_slice_spec`: a list over unique SDs (so length
        global_sd_order), where each list inside this is the list over blocks
        which contain that pytree. E.g. [[0, 1], [2]] indicates that blocks[0]
        and blocks[1] are both of pytree SD 0.
    - `node_shape_dtypes`: a dictionary mapping node types to hashable `_PyTreeStruct`
    - `node_shape_struct`: a dictionary mapping node types to pytrees of JAX-shaped
        dtype structs (just for user access, since the keys aren't hashable that
        creates issues for JAX in other areas.)
